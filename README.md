## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
*   npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rizwanishere/Student-management-frontend.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Student-management-frontend
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash

    (Or if you prefer yarn: `yarn install`)

## Running the Application

### Development Server

To start the application in development mode, run:

```bash
npm start
```
This will open the application in your default web browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`. The page will reload if you make edits.

### Building for Production

To create an optimized build of the application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```
This command bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.

### Running Tests

To launch the test runner in interactive watch mode, run:

```bash
npm test
```
(Note: This assumes test files are set up. If not, this command might not produce meaningful output without further test configuration.)
